## Why we store this information and how we use it

- To manage **temporary bans** and unban you after the defined period.
- To configure **modlog channels, prefixes, and muted roles** as set by server admins.
- To store profile data for **custom profile information**.
- Your user ID is stored for **all the above purposes and to redisplay relevant data when needed**.

## Who can read this data?

- **Users can only see they are blacklisted indirectly** (commands not working); detailed information is visible only to Vynel Admins/Developers.
- **Muted, muted role, prefix, and modlog data are accessible to Vynel Admins/Developers**. Server admins/moderators can view modlogs for their own guilds.
